In formatting your issue, please follow the templates. Deviating from the templates provided will most likely get your issue closed as invalid.

### Pull request requirements

This project requires pull requests to be either substantial, useful, or to resolve an open issue. Pull requests like "fix typo in README.md" will most likely be closed as invalid, while ones like "implement animations in pages" or "resolve #11: text sizing issues" may be considered.

Pull request titles **MUST** begin with one of the following keywords:

Pull requests that begin with a keyword other than the above _may_ be closed as invalid, especially if it's purpose is not relevant to it's description. We are happy to rename your PR, we are not happy to _rewrite_ your PR.
